# Project : Parking Lot System - Design 

This is Project for LLD System design where I have designed a Multi Story Parking lot which return the ticket and tells if parking is full for oarticluar vehicle type.
This is and extensable project where parking storey can be chosed and vehicles and be added without disturbing the existing code.
I have tried to implement Design Principle such as SOLID, DRY and KISS principles which make code easy to debug and extensable.
