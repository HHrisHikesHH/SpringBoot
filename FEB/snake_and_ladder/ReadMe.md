# Project :  Snake And Ladder

## Overview : 
    Snake and ladder is the classical game played on a board.
    When we think of board in Programming we almost always think of matrix of some sort.
    I have developed a project without matrix, without complex algorithm and optimised snake and ladder game.
    I have Designed a Worst and Best Move Predictor using HashMap.

## Glimse In Code
    
    As during the early stage of development i have made these project in a single file because i used to think the
    more files means more mess to handle but as i continued my development in springBoot i got used to handle multiple
    files and ease of making files system module.
    Here i have kept files singular
    

## Model : Player Class

###### Feel free to explore the entire code as i have written a modular code with simple and self explainatory functions and variable names.
